\section{Key points}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $varchar$ is reserved by $Oracle$ to support distinction between $null$ and empty string types. However, $varchar2$ doesn't. 
	\item Unique key 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item doesn't allow duplicate values. 
		\item a table can have more than one unique key which is not possible with primary key.
		\item can't be long/raw long
	\end{itemize}
	\item Table level constraints are used over column level constraints when the constraints need to be applied on multiple columns.
	\item Empty strings are also treated as null.
	\item $dual$ is a table owned by $sys$. sys has the data dictionary and dual is part of it. dual consists of only one row and only one column. Value is $X$ with column name $dummy$
\end{itemize}
