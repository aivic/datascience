## Whatsapp Message Freq Analyser

This minute project covers topics like:
* finding top frequent words used by your friends in a group 
* finding peak chatting time


I have done mainly following things regarding data cleaning:
* Concatenating same people chats which are taken in next line during encoding. 
* Splitting Timestamp and Chats in different columns
* Mapping phone numbers to their person holder names
* Removing messages when someone changes their numbers
* removing rows with either of the cases:
    - <image omitted>
    - <video omitted>
    - <GIF omitted>
* Visualization
