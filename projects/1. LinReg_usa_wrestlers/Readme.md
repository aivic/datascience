## Relationship between USA Wrestlers and their World Rank

The following project deploys a Linear Regression on USA Wrestlers to find their World Rank using Number of matches played by them so far. 

The database consists of various features as listed:
* Name 
* Rank 
* Weight & Height 
* Birth Place 
* DOB 
* Finisher 
* Trademark Moves 
* Matches Fought 
* Trainer 
* Students

There are over 2007 records available in the attached database file (much of the data cleaning is still required). 
Big thanks to http://www.wrestlingdata.com for maintaining the data.
