### Building features around numeric data for use in machine learning models
* Normalizing a data set to a unit length (range of [0,1]) {not remember}
* Removing outliers from a data set using quartile range selection
* Normalizing a data set using max norm
* Normalizing a data set using L1 norm
* Normalizing a data set using L2 norm
