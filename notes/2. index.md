## Introduction
The objective of this guide is to introduce the process of slicing and getting the subsets of the Pandas objects.

We will learn these operations using a dummy data stored in a CSV file and breakdown the learning process to four steps:

1. Extracting values from Pandas Series and DataFrame based on their labels.
2. Extracting values from Pandas Series and DataFrame based on their indexes.
3. Selecting columns by excluding a column from the beginning, center and from the end of a DataFrame.
4. Filtering out DataFrame columns based on a certain string.

## Understanding the dataset
We have been given with a CSV file named **`file.csv`**. Let us import the necessary library, (here Pandas) in the python environment and observe few of its first and last observations.

```python
# Importing required library
import pandas as pd

# Reading the CSV file to a Pandas DataFrame object variable, named df 
df = pd.read_csv('file.csv')

# Displaying top 5 observations of the file
df.head()
```
