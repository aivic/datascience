# Creating an adjacency matrix from network data

### Understand 
Q: Which of the following statement is correct regarding the creation of an adjacency matrix built using a weighted graph?  
A: It represents the edge weights for all the intersecting vertices.  
D: It represents the edge weights for all the vertices with incoming edges.  
D: It represents the count of incoming edges associated to each vertices  
D: It represents the count of all edges associated to each vertices  

### Apply
Q: You have an undirected network with a traingular structure. What is the adjacency matrix of this network in 1D format?  
A: 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0  
D: 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1  
D: 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1  
D: 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0  

### Analyse
You have a directed network with four nodes A, B, C and D. The node A is pointing towards node C and node C is pointing towards nodes B and D. What is the adjacency matrix of this network in 1D format such that when this 1D array is transformed into a 2D adjacency matrix, the values are filled rowwise?  
A: 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0  
D: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0  
D: 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1  
D: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1  

# Identifying common components of network metrics

### Remember
Q: Which of the following network metric provides an actual rate of transferring information?  
A: Throughput  
D: Bandwidth  
D: Latency  
D: Jitter  

### Understand
Q: What is the outcome of an increased jitter in a network?  
A: It degrades the performance of a network  
D: It increases the stability of a network  
D: It helps to reduce the signal to noise ratio  
D: It decreases the bandwidth of a network drastically 

### Apply
Q: You are designing a 50 kilometers of spreaded network and need to test its performance. What is the latency of the network in seconds?  
A: 1.6E-4  
D: 1.6E-5  
D: 2.9E-4  
D: 2.9E-5
