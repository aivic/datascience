### Remember
Q: Which of the following metric can be used to calculate similarity between images?  
A: Pattern intensity  
D: Mutual correlation  
D: Mean correlation  
D: Normalized information  

### Understand
Q: Which of the following statement is true about calculating image similarity using histogram method?

D: It is faster than keypoints approach combined with decision trees  
D: It is suitable for measuring similarity of scaled and rotated images  
D: It is not suitable for measuring similarity of cropped images.  

### Apply
Q: You need to find similarity of 2 images using pHash method. What is the Bit Error Rate (BER) for pHash, given number of bit errors are 24 and length of perceptual hash is 52?  
A: 0.46   
D: 2.16  
D: 4.89  
D: 254.75  

### Analyse
